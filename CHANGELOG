## [1.0.7] - 2017-02-26
### Ensure references are cited in Journal of Open Source Software paper

## [1.0.6] - 2018-02-01

## [1.0.5] - 2018-02-01
### Fix typo in Journal of Open Source Software paper

## [1.0.4] - 2018-02-01
### Addresses comments from the Journal of Open Source Software review

## [1.0.3] - 2017-06-07
### Adds paper for The Journal of Open Source Software

## [1.0.2] - 2016-12-01
### Ensure that package check tools ignore NSE vars

## [1.0.1] - 2016-11-30
### Fixes package metadata for CRAN

## [1.0.0] - 2016-11-29
### First stable release
- This is just a "rebranding" of 0.7.0. Zero changes to the code.

## [0.7.0] - 2016-09-22
### Bugfix release
- Fixes regression bug introduced by version 0.4.1

## [0.6.0] - 2016-09-16
### Bugfix release
- Adds spatial domain checking to CI interpolation

## [0.5.0] - 2016-09-13
### Bugfix release
- Note the minor version bump to indicate an API change from 0.4.2
  (which really *should* have been minor version bump... sorry users!)
- Reverts another attempt a parallel reordering. This appears to be
  impossible without a cluster file system or some really weird HDF5
  software configuration that we cannot identify.
- Adds _FillValue = NaNf attribute to output variables

## [0.4.2] - 2016-09-08
### Documentation and naming release
- Adds documentation for global options
- Adds documentation for parallelization usage
- Adds academic references to all wrapper functions
- Renames functions to correspond to scientific literature

## [0.4.1] - 2016-09-02
### Memory management release
- Small changes ensuring that garbage collection happens at the end of
  each chunked I/O loop. This helps contain the memory requirements on
  large compute jobs.

## [0.4.0] - 2016-08-19
### Bugfix release (alters results of computations)
- Fixes an issue where QDM results were transposed during reording during certain cases

## [0.3.0] - 2016-08-08
### Bugfix release (alters results of computations)
- Fixes an issue with QPQM reordering (ensures that reordering happens for each cell)
- Adds two global options: check.neg.precip and check.units which can be used to enable/disable checks during data input

## [0.2.3] - 2016-07-15
### Bugfix release
- Adds robustness to BCCA grid aggregation

## [0.2.2] - 2016-07-05
### Bugfix release
- Adds a third dimension of n.analogues to apply analogues function
- Combines calibration date user options
- Uses spatially sorted order in QPQM reordering
- Ensures negative precip is removed from all pipeline stages
- Omits the use of calibration start date for the GCM in QPQM
- Ports TravisCI to use native R language support without sudo

## [0.2.1] - 2016-06-23
### Bugfix release
- Reverts parallel support for BCCA analogue application (pending investigation)

## [0.2.0] - 2016-06-08
### Bugfix and testing release
- Adds integration tests for all downscaling methods and sets thereof
- Add tests for BCCI's chunked.factored.running.mean
- Factors out variable reading to perform all unit conversion and negative precip removal in one place
- Adds better logic for checking for overlap in configured time ranges
- Fixes a corner case in QPQM's muliyear block mode
- Adds a config option for 'target.units'
- Ensures that QDM and QPQM both use parallel main loops if available
- Adds a repo README and contributors' guide

## [0.1.0] - 2016-04-20
### First Release
- All QDM/BCCAQv2 methods are fully implemented and can be run
  end-to-end
