Description: A suite of routines for downscaling coarse scale global
    climate model (GCM) output to a fine spatial resolution. Includes
    Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCDS), Constructed Analogues
    (CA), Climate Imprint (CI), and Bias Correction/Constructed
    Analogues with Quantile mapping reordering (BCCAQ). Developed by
    the the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC), Victoria,
    British Columbia, Canada.
